# surpriseBox

My final Project for my Networked Media class. In inspiration of the magic 8-ball, I created a cube that produces different search results based on a user's query. You simply open the webpage, search for any word and each face of the cube will show a different result. Currently, it is accessing the Twitter API so the images you see are images people have tweeted about your query. Lastly, you can open webpage on your phone as well and use it as a remote to rotate the box.
